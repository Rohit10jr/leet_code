# 🐍 LeetCode Python Notebook Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to various [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems, written in Python and organized as Jupyter Notebooks. Each notebook includes the problem statement, code, and explanations — sometimes with multiple approaches.

## 🚀 Getting Started

You can view or run the notebooks using:

- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Jupyter extension
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (upload the `.ipynb` file)

## 🐍 Python Virtual Environment Setup

To keep your dependencies isolated, it's recommended to use a virtual environment. Here’s how you can create and activate one, and confirm it’s running:

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

```powershell
python -m venv venv
```

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate
```

### 3. Confirm the Current Python Environment

You can check the current Python executable path to ensure you’re using the virtual environment:

```python
import sys
print(sys.executable)
```

This should print a path containing `venv`.

## 📦 Install Jupyter Notebook

To work with the notebooks, you need to have Jupyter installed. You can install it using pip:

```powershell
pip install jupyter
```

Or, run:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
