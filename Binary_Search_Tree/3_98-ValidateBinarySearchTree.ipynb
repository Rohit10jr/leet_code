    "Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).\n",
    "\n",
    "A valid BST is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.\n",
    "The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.\n",
    "Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: root = [2,1,3]\n",
    "    Output: true\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",

    "    Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]\n",
    "    Output: false\n",

    "Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4."
